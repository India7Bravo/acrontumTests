# Acrontum Automation Test

This project is for a lovely company named Acrontum. 

What the test does, is it's able to follow the journey of a user logging in, adding a book to their collection and then deleting it at the end so when the tests need to be run again, they're able to perform the same journey without breakage.

**I would also like to say I have added a little bit of code to the file "index.json" to help avoid an error originating from the application code.

# How to run the tests

* Make sure to either clone or download a copy of the code
* Open the folder in your preferred IDE
* Run: "npm install"
* Run: "npx cypress open" to open cypress

Once Cypress is open, run the Acrontum Tests :) 

I hope you've enjoyed this :)
